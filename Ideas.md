# TROLLET MiniGame Project #

The TROLLET MiniGame Project (from now on TMP) is an idea of bringing multiple games together as one.

As the game starts you will be presented with a menu where you can choose your game.
All games will be small and have easy gameplay and have an arcade-feel towards them and feature their own highscore table.

Obviously they will all feature TROLLET somehow, hence the name.

Below I will present some of the ideas I have.


## TROLLET Classic ##

TROLLET Classic was the first (graphical) game I ever programmed on my own, using Fenix.
This was where TROLLET was first born and his mission was to dodge enemies.
He did not have any powers, the only object of the game was to avoid the falling enemies, making sure you did not get hit. The longer you survived, the higher the score.

In TMP, there will be two main modes available, and possibly a third:
  * Classic
    * Score Attack
  * Modern
    * Score Attack
    * Multiplayer
    * Possibly other modes, time attack?
  * Retro (if I have time, this mode will allow you to play the first version of the game)
Classic will probably be a direct port of the Nintendo DS-port (if that makes any sense) and the Modern will have some new ideas and possibly better graphics and higher resolution.


## TROLLMan ##

TROLLMan will be a platform game heavily inspired by an old Amiga-demo known as Platman, the object of the game is to collect keys and candy, unlock doors and move on.


## TROLLET: Adventure ##

Those of you who was here during the Atari-age probably know of a game called Adventure. Well, TROLLET was there too..


## TROLLBlox ##

What is a classic game collection without a blockgame? Clear lines and survive, simple as that. (or is it?)


## SpaceTROLL ##

Similar to "Space Invaders", but more modern and with powerups.
